### Founder members

Founder members each paid at least £100 (nominally as a ten year membership fee) to the BCA to set up starting funds to enable the association to function until it could collect futher membership fees.

By July 1982, the BCA had 37 founder members and funds of £7050. It also had support from several corporate members: Pye Unicom Ltd, Marconi Avionics Ltd, Nicolet Instruments Ltd, Enraf Nonius, and Stoe and Cie (Gmbh).

Later 43 of the Founder members signed their names in the beginning of the BCA AGM Minutes book, but not all of them are legible. The March 1983 issue 4 of ‘Crystallography news’ page 3 states that ‘The total number of Founder members is 51.’
